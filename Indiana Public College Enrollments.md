This study examines enrollment patterns across different public, postsecondary institutions in Indiana using a dataset containing 404 records from 2005 to 2017. The data includes variables such as institution type (public, 2-year or 4-year), residency status (resident or non-resident), degree level, and enrollment counts. The purpose of this analysis is to explore how factors like residency and program type affect student enrollment numbers, particularly in community and technical colleges. Through this, the study aims to uncover trends in educational access and institutional preferences of the Indiana student population. Anticipated challenges include interpreting categorical variables with nuanced meanings (for example, “Unclassified undergraduate”), dealing with potential data sparsity in less common degree levels, and ensuring that enrollment counts are comparable across institution sectors. These challenges will be addressed through careful preprocessing, categorization, and filtering of the dataset for accurate comparisons. The insights derived from this dataset will inform on access, affordability, and demographic shifts in higher education enrollment.











Review enrollment by fiscal year and institution data distribution:

From fiscal year 2011 to 2017, a 19.5% decrease in enrollment occurred with the assurance of institution data distribution to be fairly even ranging from recorded institution counts of 28 to 32.
Enrollment decreased by almost 5% from 2005 to 2017.

Review residency status to uncover enrollment decline contribution:

Non-resident student enrollment steadily increases as resident student enrollment decreases.
Review distribution of program type:
2005-2017:

2005:
2017:
Enrollment distribution reveals student preferences in bachelor programs and in more quickly completed programs increases from 2005 to 2017 as preferences in other 4 year programs decreases. 

An overall decrease in student enrollment occurred and we were able to uncover how residency status and program degree level affected this occurrence. 
As resident student enrollment decreased, non-resident student enrollment increased. A strong preference in more long term programs existed from 2005 to 2017. A slight decreased preference in long term programs and slight increase in short term programs occurred.
Dataset adjustments included established date hierarchy in the fiscal year attribute and creating a measure on residency status.
The insights derived from this dataset uncovered trends in educational access and institutional preferences of the Indiana student population.
